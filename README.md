# Turbine Blade Defect Scanner

## 🎯 Problem
Current drone-based inspection systems use area cameras, causing geometric distortions 
when imaging curved turbine blade surfaces. This requires complex 3D reconstruction 
and introduces measurement errors.

## 💡 Solution
Line-scan imaging system that captures distortion-free surface "unrolls" through 
controlled mechanical scanning.

## 🔧 Technical Approach
1. **Hardware**: Line-scan sensor + precision linear actuator
2. **Software**: Real-time stitching + ML-based defect detection
3. **Output**: Metrically accurate defect maps
